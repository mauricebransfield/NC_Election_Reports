# Introduction

### Creates registration and turnout reports for the 2016 and 2020 General Elections in North Carolina, as well as comparing the two elections.

Each report includes:
* Counts on registration by party
* Counts on turnout by party
* Counts on absentee ballots cast by party
* Each party's percentage of registrants
* Turnout percentage by party
* Each party's percentage of absentee ballots cast
* Each party's percentage of votes cast
* The difference between each party's percetange of registrants and percentage of votes

Each year has a report broken down by county and geographic area. A third set of reports compares the 2020 and 2016 elections.  Because of the Green and Constitution parties of North Carolina achieving ballot access between the two elections, all third parties and Unaffiliateds are aggregated into "Other."

The geographic reports break North Carolina into three geographic areas:
* The 4 largest counties ("Urban4")
* The 5th through 20th largest counties ("Suburban16")
* The remaining counties, ie 21st through 100th largest ("Rural80")
